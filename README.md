## Description:  
* Immerse yourself in a world where you are trapped in a dark forest with only a miner's helmet to light your way and a machete to hold.  
* Try to survive as long as possible while a monster approaches.  
* This game was made in 3 days in Project99's Level 99 VR Bootcamp by a group of developers with little experience.
